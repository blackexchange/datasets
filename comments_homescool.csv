There are a lot of us out there. My kids are awesome people. I enjoy spending time with them and allowing them the freedom to learn based on their interests and in a way they respond best. Sometimes homeschooling isn‚Äôt about making any religious or political statement; it‚Äôs about loving your children and desiring them to reach their best potential.

She was/is a teacher, a curriculum developer and was a deputy superintendent..We got an education that was almost on par with standard public school. So by the time we transitioned to public high school, we were able to just slide right on in..B U T..She never homeschooled us for a political/religious/conspiratorial reason.It was simply because the school on the Reservation I grew up on didn't have quality education. She got sick of the GENUINE educational neglect, and decided to take things into her own hands..These guys aren't even educated themselves ü§£"

I would be done my schoolwork by noon, and be outside playing till dinner every day. We had 3 month long summers because we were able to finish our semesters early, due to there being 3 kids for 1 teacher instead of 30 kids..We've expressed interest about homeschooling our kids to friends and family, reason being that we could give them a similar upbringing, not be tied down to a rigid schedule, or one place..But most of the people we've told get excited and start talking about how 'the world is getting so crazy nowadays', and I know they're excited because of the same reasons the people in this documentary have..Makes me feel gross knowing these people think I share their delusions about conspiracies and religious fervor, I just want my family to have a rad life"

I have a feeling it won‚Äôt turn out all that well. Most in this video are being home schooled for all the wrong reasons. If you have a good reason, it will stand up to criticism rather than retreating to their bubble."

Both of them were home schooled for part of their education but not all of it. It was because I live in rural Virginia and the schools are much more regressive than the schools in Seattle where I moved from. There were a lot of discipline problems when my older son was in school, so he did middle school homeschooled and then went back to school for high school. My younger son is on the autism spectrum so I pulled him out after 6th grade and he finished school homeschooled. It was their choice, we did secular homeschooling, we did a lot of co-ops so they were around other children and I saw a lot of things that scared me. In the state where I live you can declare homeschooling for religious reasons and never have to show a test result. I saw kids that were woefully ignorant of common knowledge and I also saw two different occasions of abusers who didn't want their kids in school because counselors were asking too many questions. I think it's disgusting how children's education has been co-opted by the fear mongerers. at the very least someone who's homeschooling should have to test their child and they should have to pass a basic test for knowledge for their age."

I think it's important to realize people pulling their kids out of public school is a symptom that public education in the USA is seriously flawed.
Si ‚ù§Ô∏è,https://yt3.ggpht.com/xZs2MlnAY1QkUDJkkPQUL37Ia7YSiE0-lMT98FPZIdCmZE3mmewFztPwpze3DKooQu0RyN9Ha1Y=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,554,2022-10-16T13:59:31Z,2022-10-16T13:59:31Z,"I am a homeschooling parent. Not all homeschoolers are as politically driven as some of these people being interviewed. In fact, I wish it wasn‚Äôt portrayed as such a political weapon rather than a powerful tool in a child‚Äôs education. Homeschoolers can learn and move through curriculum at their own pace. They normally excel because they don‚Äôt have to compete with a large classroom for individualized instruction that fits their academic needs. I also love that I can teach my children more about their culture. At the same time I think it can be a disservice for the ones who pull their kids and decide to not teach them about other cultures all in the name of ‚ÄúCRT‚Äù (which is not taught in schools k-12 btw). Homeschooling is a powerful tool and as mentioned I will fight for my right to homeschool because I know that it is what is best for my children. But I don‚Äôt have the same reasons as some of these people. It actually makes me annoyed to hear these people pushing their political agendas on to these children. In my homeschool I teach my children. As they grow older and learn about politics they can decide their own political stance."

I loved it! I was able to get the one on one teaching I NEEDED,I did other programs with other homeschooled children who later became my friends twice a week,I began to excel once we found a method that actually worked for me. I was always and will always be so grateful to my Parents for doing what they did,I wouldn't have changed a thing. I'm in my early 30's now,I graduated College,became a Welder for 3 years,a warehouse manager for 2,a CNA for 2 and now run my own Business. Homeschool is such an amazing tool for your child if done RIGHT."

I've done extraordinarily well for myself and experienced first hand the benefits of the flexibility/1:1 to accommodate my apd. But I want to make something clear: the real dangers of homeschooling are parents who homeschool for non-educational reasons (crt, religion, political). However, as far as education goes, if done right, it is arguably better because you get a more customized curriculum for that student needs/strengths/weaknesses."

For the kids sake I truly hope their experiment sets these and others up for a life of success.  Personally, Finland has the highest quality of education in the world and everyone attends public schools.  Not to mention the economic privilege that people have to even consider a homeschool option."

It *can* be very helpful for a lot of children. But the reality is that a significant number of parents neglect their children's education and/or use homeschooling as an excuse to control and abuse their children. None of my siblings (myself included) received an adequate education and those still under 18 live in a high-control environment with little freedom."

I've been on both sides of the fence. Private school for elementary, homeschooled for middle school and most of high school and now community college. There are pros and cons to all types of education. Don't pick a side. Stay cultured. Have convictions. Explore. Try things. Love people. This is what grows good people. Not just books or the building. The school of life is my favorite."

I asked but was ignored. As an adult I find that I wasn‚Äôt stupid but the environment I was in at school made hard for me to grow and made me even more shy at as a teenager. My choice to homeschool my girls at least for primary school was based on my experience. I want to make sure my girls grow on their pace and not feel discouraged but build confidence."

It was almost exactly like school, except I could do as much or as little a day. As long as I did all the tests and had the courses finished by end of year. Up here at least, home schooling just means from home. Learn the same things as those in school..This is insanity."

It's crazy how much better you can learn with homeschool. Most of my cousins were homeschooled and they all have university degrees and are insanely interesting as they have a huge capacity for critical thought.

I am worry about the mental health of public school teachers, if this is what comes out during an interview about being a public school teacher... Maybe, taking kids out of the home, away from their families, maybe  taking parents away from their children to be raised by others isn't a great system. We took a potential great thing and used it and abused it. Public education was never supposed to replace the family, it was supposed to help it. ..I'm frustrated by the way this was framed. Do you know how much money is lost to families who homeschool? They do not stop paying taxes to the school system. All books, and all curriculum has to be bought by the family. The potential for an entire income is lost. Please stop framing it as if homeschool families are taking something away financial from the system. They're not. Homeschooling puts them at a great financial disadvantage. but apparently, it's worth it."

I used to work with my mom and then I started taking classes with other homeschoolers once a week. Honestly, it was like a college. I loved it and wouldn‚Äôt have changed it for anything. I graduated from college, moved abroad, and now speak three languages. I was educated but I certainly know other ‚Äúhomeschoolers‚Äù that didn‚Äôt actually study.

If you homeschool, there is a very high chance you are setting your children up for severe emotional and social dysfunction. Also, homeschooling leads children up having gaps in their education. I grew up thinking I was fundamentally terrible at math. I went to college and found out I was actually rather good at it. My parents were just bad at teaching it. There will just always be blind spots like this, even if the parents involved are not actively indoctrinating their children into Christian nationalism.  It's just a bad idea."

Same once I entered the workforce and realized that being able to read and learn things on your own, think logically and creatively, and be resourceful are much more important. 10 years later and I‚Äôm happily married with kids, living a pretty typical life. ..What I‚Äôm trying to say, I guess, is that there is no right or wrong way to do school. I think that parents and the support they give to their kids is way more important, whether the kids are going to school or staying at home"

My dad used me to get government support and child support checks from my mom, and the school used me for their attendance stats. I was fully responsible and the teachers knew it. I did the work, then logged in as the parent account to input attendance then log right back out. What did they have a problem with in this situation? The fact that I was putting the real time it takes to get through their lessons, 15-20 minutes, and they wanted me to put an hour for each class regardless. They even set it up so that if you click to input your time, it always defaults to an hour so you can literally just click down the list and hit ""send"". When my grades started slipping because obviously a depressed, socially isolated teenager isn't going to play along with this obvious bullshit system, they would call ME to issue ultimatums about my grades and assignments. The only calls the PARENT got was to ask to speak to me about it. I even have one of the voicemails they left him because he emailed it to me like I'm an employee...The ""benefit"" of homeschooling can only be reaped by rich white Christians where the daddy has a well paying job handed to him and mommy stays at home. Funny how it also benefits Christians by allowing them to indoctrinate their kids better. It's almost as if homeschooling is being pushed because even private school isn't insulating enough against reality for christians."

I was homeschooled in Montana my whole life without ever going to a school, I'm 34 now for context. I come from a large family and there are a lot of homeschoolers in my community who also have large families. Were predominantly a mix of protestant and Mormon faiths. Everyone's primary reason for homeschooling was religion. That said, some are more extreme the others. For instance; my family was super strict on some things, and very loose on others. All the homeschoolers in my area are self-employed as pastors, tradesmen, accountants, or farmers/ranchers. ..There were two types of homeschoolers: the dedicated to education/spelling bee ones who typically go on to super successful lives post college, and the ones who skip college to enter the family business full time...Many homeschoolers are enrolled at least part-time in their local community colleges by the time they're in high-school to help learn subjects their parents aren't qualified to teach. This means by the time they graduate high-school and transition to college, they're more prepared than the average private or public school student. Additionally, working with our families in business during childhood teaches us a lot of things many other kids wouldn't know - strong work ethics, practical knowledge of a trade, and a taste of what adulthood looks like...Homeschooling can either be the greatest thing for a child because they can receive more time and training in school, putting them ahead of their public and private school peers, or it can be the worst thing if they are smothered with religion and don't receive even a basic education...I'm an engineer, another sibling is an engineer, another sibling is a mathematician, others are working the family business, so my family has been very successful partially as a result of homeschooling, and partially because my parents were smart enough to keep religion out of our education. We all have multiple degrees and value learning..The problem is with the mainstream homeschoolers who have crazy ideas about religion to the point of clinical insanity...Homeschooling has perhaps the *greatest* potential amongst all the learning types because of the amount of time, attention, and creativity a parent or teacher can provide to the student. That said, many fall flat as a result of misguided faith and religion...Also, I should note, my family was considered lower middle class, some families are near poverty level - for those saying only privlieged families can homeschool."

One piece that would be very interesting is to look into districts budgeting. Looking into the shortage of teachers would give an interesting perspective as well. ..I believe our education system is a reflection of our society. Our schools are a reflection of our community and values...Teaching can be very rewarding but also life sucking. Teachers could put 100% into their craft or do the bare minimum. ..I can‚Äôt help but bring up safety. Reality, most us do not feel safe in public areas. Our solutions there are exact opposite. If we cannot agree on how to keep our babies safe in a classroom we are definitely not ready to discuss learning curriculums or lack there of them. ..Praying for our future. üòÖ"

I performed really well on my SAT & ACTs and got into college. I went on to end up getting 2 degrees, and a masters, masters in nursing, which is no cake walk. ..While there are ppl like the ones in this video who are really into homeschooling for various reasons, as well as a lot of religious reasons, there are a lot of homeschoolers out there who even though they may come from a family that does have a religion (I am Catholic for example, but my religion played no part in me homeschooling), they‚Äôre not specifically homeschooling for those reasons and their kids are getting an excellent education - one much better than they would have been able to get in public schools. ..I really wish documentaries would actually include focusing on those families and kids! I see many other commenters in this comment section saying they were homeschooled as well and this video doesn‚Äôt represent what their experience was like! It‚Äôs just so tiring. Every documentary or video on homeschooling has always focuses on the religious, political or more radical reasons ppl homeschool, their families and aspects of homeschooling. It‚Äôs insane that I was dealing w that representation of ‚Äúthis is what homeschooling is and it‚Äôs so dangerous!‚Äù In the 90‚Äôs and now here we are 30 years later and it‚Äôs still being represented that way!

One on one instruction, teaching at their level, and enrichment...However, reality is far more brutal. Sometimes I have students enter the system who have been homeschooled. Within the first few days I quiz them about what they were learning about or where they left off, in the hopes of building continuity in their education. And the answer? ""I wasn't learning anything."" or ""I haven't been in school for X years""...It is sad how often it occurs, and all I can do is help them while I have them. However fleeting that is."

So I looked towards the youth of my church who were homeschooled and their parents. With their help and I was able to structure a plan that suited me. Those habits transferred with me to on campus learning. I have a deep respect for homeschooled students and their families.

Its way better funding, teachers actually look happy to teach, but honestly the people there are the same people I met in public school so theres no difference there. My parents make more money now so they can afford the charter school, but I can imagine how hard it can be to put your child in charter school of you dont make a lot of money. Honestly the more we move away from public schools, has me scared that once again the poor will not have a right to be educated as others. It creates a cycle of being poor. I was always the smartest person in class in my public school but when I went off to college I saw the better quality of education that other people were getting at other schools. My public schools never assigned homework on computer (like math homework done solely on computers), when I went to college everyone had done that for years, and I was stuck learning how to do math on a computer.

If i choose to teach my son solely on what I believe, he is then limited to only knowing what I choose and how I choose to teach him. I believe that public/private/home schooling should work hand and hand to create a holisic environment of learning. I talk ALOT with my sons teacher, I am a home room parent, and I work full time. We work TOGETHER to give my son the tools he needs to grasp concepts. I have gotten great tips from his teacher to use at home and I have made useful suggestions to his teacher to improve his experience at school. ..We need to stop thinking that kids only learn in school. I think that public schools will need to stop focusing on scores and tests, and work closely with parents and Home and School Associations to create the complete environment each child needs to grow. If you just drop your child off at a building and expect the teacher to do everything, your child will not benefit, and I honestly believe, that if you teach your child at home how you WANT to teach them, and not how they learn best, your child will also not benefit."

My parents are both top university graduate and my mother even have a master degree in children psychology. I'm blessed with private teacher, great source, great parents, just like school but more suitable for me. My studying has become more efficient and this has made me fell in love with studying. I can learn like normal kids my age and even surpass my friends from both the formal school and homeschool (in terms of grades and subjects, and i was strictly prohibited from cheating), doing my passion and hobbies, getting closer with my family. And surprisingly, not to be a narcissist or whatever, through homeschool i became more independent, more mature than kids my age, knowing and understanding myself more, and understanding of how things work in real life, which if without homeschool, i doubt i would be the person i am rn. Homeschool may not be for everyone but for me it's a blessing...So i think just found what suits you best would be the best option since none of us are the same."

I may not agree with everything in public schools but thats the point.

(He dropped from A/B to F.)  For us it was a combination of keeping him safe from Covid and minimizing stress (we had a house fire before the pandemic and he had to move 5 times).  He's older now, so we're trying a dedicated public online school to ease him back in.   The stereotype is that homeschooling is done for religious or political reasons, but sometimes it's just about responding to practical needs, educational or life...Thankfully local government is pretty chill about it.

That is truly wonderful, but it's not the story for everyone. ..My best friend was homeschooled by her parents until she renrolled in high school. She was overwhelmed and struggled immensely in high school and the ""real"" world outside of her home. She was raised in a very isolated environment with parents who barely knew math, science, or grammar, and when she finally joined public school, she struggled immensely just to keep up and had to relearn almost everything on her own. She wasn't the only former homeschool kid I knew in high school who faced a lot of issues. Although not all of them struggled, most had emotional, social, and academic problems that followed them into college and beyond. I think it's important to remember that while most of the parents in this video are bright and responsible people that provide ample, positive education for their children, there are also many homeschool parents who lack education and awareness and are not actually capable of providing a proper and applicable education to their children. Unrestricted and unregulated homeschooling can give some parents the ability to isolate and control their children, causing only harm and doing minimal good. ..Not to mention the fact that here in rural Indiana, the majority of homeschoolers are indoctrinated hardcore into Christianity, which isn't inherently bad, but, again, it can cause a lot of awful and traumatizing issues when they finally leave home and go to college, get a job, and start socializing with people who are different from them. ..I can definitely understand the appeal of homeschooling, especially nowadays, but it is also far from a perfect system. Oversight and protections are needed for homeschool kids, too."

I home school because the public school system was failing my special needs child. They had such bad experiences there, the trauma so bad, that even changing schools didn't help. My school district has no alternative programs, resulting in my child having no education for over a year. We tried a religious based program that was  racist and xenophobic with no guidance at all. I'm college educated but honestly I am completely inept at sharing what I know. Especially in math. I know of other families who have had to turn to homeschooling because of bullying."

I can say without a doubt she would not be excelling in life at this young of an age in a public school. Comparatively to my child in public and others in my life, the knowledge, introspection and well rounded intellect just don't match up. If you do this for the proper reasons, I truly believe it is far superior to most public schools today. Plus your children stay closer to you and and their family due to not being away for 8 hours a day where they learn less. For example, with information at our finger tips and access to literature, there are more efficient methods to absorb and apply information than text books and classrooms with 20 plus peers."

My brother was in second grade and my sister in sixth grade. We were all extremely ahead (like 1-2 years) of our peers. We only had a few hours of schooling a day and went out to play or read or whatever we wanted the rest of the time. My mom taught us and did not have a college degree or excel when she was in school herself. The programs created for homeschooling do a very good job of fostering independent learning. We did lots of sports and went to church and had neighbor kids to play with, for socialization. The drawbacks were some social struggling when starting school because kids learn to be so damned mean at school! We were kind and empathetic kids who stood up for the bullied and disabled kids. It was really hard for us to see kids be so mean, and hard when they were mean to us."

However, homeschooling can be wonderful for many families! I grew up homeschooled along with my four sisters through all of elementary, middle, and high school. All of my sisters and I got way above average scores on the ACT (mine was a 29, my older sisters‚Äô were 28 and 30. I don‚Äôt know my younger sister‚Äôs score). And for the three of us who decided to go to college, my oldest sister and I who have bachelors degrees graduated with highest honors and differing baccalaureate awards and my little sister is currently getting her associates degree and getting all A‚Äôs. People are so worried that homeschoolers won‚Äôt be able to succeed in life, but I always am frustrated by this because there are so many public schoolers who aren‚Äôt succeeding and nobody ever brings up that. All of my friends were all local kids who either went to public or private schools and I remember them coming over to play and begging my mom to homeschool them too because they saw how much fun we were having while learning and that we were actually able to learn and explore and grow as individuals. Which isn‚Äôt something that all public schoolers are able to easily do in a public school environment when an underpaid and overworked teacher has his/her attention divided amongst 20+ kids and about 50% of class time is simply spent on behavioral management. Not knocking public schools, I just think we need to be honest about how the public education system in America currently sucks (and, yes, deserves more funding) and not start to shift the blame for that onto parents who have simply recognized that and then choose to privatize their kids‚Äô education for their kids‚Äô benefit."

The way my dad explained math didn't always make sense and I would get really confused. I feel like I would have benefited from a teacher that had a deeper understanding of the content as well as multiple teaching styles to help different types of learners. ..My parents homeschooled for religious reasons, so my education was half Bible study and half actual learning content. The way they would teach science and always tack on ""and that's how God made it"" to anything that might seem to support evolution, or how every piece of history was twisted to support colonialism and white Christian nationalism. It has been a very concerted effort on my part as an adult to correct those things in my mind."

Ironically, I began homeschooling just prior to the pandemic. It was due to my then 6 year old finding it impossible to adapt, and feel safe in the charter school chaos. He was anxious, and learning nothing. His behavior at home began to decline. The teacher he began with left for maternity leave, never returning. Replaced by a revolving door of substitutes that were not accustomed to younger students. The lack of consistency was counterintuitive. Then there was the long day, removal of outside recess as a means of discipline. The list goes on. His poor teacher would often get back to us at 11pm claiming to have just gotten home from school that late in the evening. My infant at the time got sick and hospitalized from the constant illnesses that my older child was carrying home too. We do know that there are detrimental effects of masking the faces of young children in terms of language, psychological, and emotional development. With very little proof of efficacy. As soon as these masked kids would settle to eat lunch, the masks are removed lol. It‚Äôs such nonsense. We don‚Äôt homeschool due to that or politics/religion. We homeschool because my child learns best when he feels safe, and when the curriculum can be tailored for his specific learning style. Once he was recovered from the trauma of his conventional school experienced, I could not have been√Ø prouder of how beautifully he has acclimated. He is mature, responsible, takes accountability, is kind, and he reads constantly for enjoyment. I think homeschooled kids are going go change their generations future."

I wasn't understanding anything because they were not teaching me in ways I could understand. And it didn't help that I was chronically ill and disabled and the schools refused to give me any accommodations. Heck, my local public school put me on homebound and sent teachers, but literally said to my parents' faces while I was in the room that I was going to fail and that they weren't even trying to help me get to graduation! Ableist much to tell a disabled kid that they can never succeed in life!? And keep in mind that this school was considered the best in my district. Highly revered in my state as an amazing school..I learned SO much better while homeschooling because I was able to learn in the ways I needed and I was able to get the one-on-one learning that public and private schools don't do. The decision was about my well-being and not about politics. My siblings did great in either public or private school. I just didn't. .Also, even though my state doesn't have mandatory testing, my co-op always did the testing anyways. Most co-ops I have heard about around here do, actually. Homeschool parents DO want their kids to be learning. It's not a get-out-of-jail-free card. All the homeschool kids I know went through stricter learning than any mainstream school kid."

By the time we finished the school year he was reading at a second grade level, was familiar with the 50 states, learned about the stock market daily, and was creating simple video games with arcademaker. Now in 2nd grade his national scores for reading are at 99 he also gets an A for every subject. He can spell better than most adults. He saw me using software to create early reading books and decided to use it to create his own books. He published an adorable coloring book 2 weeks ago and has already sold over 40 of them. I didn't even have to teach him to use the software. He figured it out. One of the biggest advantages to homeschooling is the the teacher is usually a parent or grandparent and is completely emotionally invested in the welfare of the child."

I know people that it was great for and others that would have been much better in school. It really depends on the individual kid, the parents, and their educational system and social life. Upon going to university, I found out that my academic skills are at least average, maybe a little higher in some areas, so homeschooling did not hurt me in that regard. I think maybe I should have went to school just for social reasons, however, because I am so shy, I never wanted to join clubs or any of the social activities my homeschool friends and siblings were part of. My parents are very balanced and gave me the option to go to school but my social anxiety was so high, I never wanted to go. I guess I would have liked to have gone from a very early age but who knows, maybe I would still be extremely shy. .I am seeing now how it probably harmed my peers as a lot of my former homeschool friends turned out to be Trump loving, anti-vaxer, conspiracy theorists. .Homeschooling for religious reasons kind of sets off red flags for me although I am a religious person myself. It can work well for some families though and between Covid, shootings, bullies, and the frequent mistreatment of special needs children, the decision to homeschool is definitely understandable and may be the better option for some families."

I had a great experience.  Many of my friends also had a good experiences. I believe I am a well-rounded individual who has friends that are liberal and conservative-from every walk of life. I believe homeschooling can be a successful thing for your family if done with thought and intentionality. I am married to a wonderful woman, have a baby on the way, doing great in my sales career. I have several siblings who are also doing great, my sister became a paralegal for one of the largest real estate law firms in our state. My brother got his degree in robotics, and now works for the city and their water department, in addition to him being technician for Blackhawk helicopters for the national guard. My homeschool graduate brother-in-law has a masters degree as a teacher- He teaches math and science at a local high school. One of my friends got a full ride scholarship to our state college for bio engineering at the age of 16, his brother also got a scholarship to the same state school. Not every homeschooler is a great success story, but most of the ones I know are. ..I have also worked with thousands of kids and teens from my community and surrounding areas. So many were falling through the cracks and not getting the attention or the education they needed. Many of them were literally failing classes- and then once Covid started I saw that number multiply. So my thought is before trying to come after homeschoolers, maybe those people should focus on improving the school situation."

Primarily the group did the extracurricular activities such as Art, Speech, and my favorite was Personal Education. My mother and a friend made this available, and our group shifted towards a special needs group. We had members that had autism and down syndrome. I as one of the most senior and integrated members of this group was put into a very interesting position. I knew the valuable contributions of this group, but I also knew at a subconscious level that I was being put into a echo chamber. Looking back now, I wish I had taken my moms advice to go straight from a middle school level into community college. Homeschooling can definitely be a burden and a boon, and the fact that I left my group at the high school level can only be described that I made a choice. This video may describe a majority of current homeschoolers, or it might not. I stick by the fact that my mothers choice to homeschool me was a boon, and not a burden to those I grew up with."

Upon going to university, I found out that my academic skills are at least average, maybe a little higher in some areas, so homeschooling did not hurt me in that regard. I think maybe I should have went to school just for social reasons, however, because I am so shy, I never wanted to join clubs or any of the social activities my homeschool friends and siblings were part of. My parents are very balanced and gave me the option to go to school but my social anxiety was so high, I never wanted to go. I guess I would have liked to have gone from a very early age but who knows, maybe I would still be extremely shy. .I am seeing now how it probably harmed my peers as a lot of my former homeschool friends turned out to be Trump loving, anti-vaxer, conspiracy theorists. .Homeschooling for religious reasons kind of sets off red flags for me although I am a religious person myself. It can work well for some families though and between Covid, shootings, bullies, and the frequent mistreatment of special needs children, the decision to homeschool is definitely understandable and may be the better option for some families."

I had a great experience.  Many of my friends also had a good experiences. I believe I am a well-rounded individual who has friends that are liberal and conservative-from every walk of life. I believe homeschooling can be a successful thing for your family if done with thought and intentionality. I am married to a wonderful woman, have a baby on the way, doing great in my sales career. I have several siblings who are also doing great, my sister became a paralegal for one of the largest real estate law firms in our state. My brother got his degree in robotics, and now works for the city and their water department, in addition to him being technician for Blackhawk helicopters for the national guard. My homeschool graduate brother-in-law has a masters degree as a teacher- He teaches math and science at a local high school. One of my friends got a full ride scholarship to our state college for bio engineering at the age of 16, his brother also got a scholarship to the same state school. Not every homeschooler is a great success story, but most of the ones I know are. ..I have also worked with thousands of kids and teens from my community and surrounding areas. So many were falling through the cracks and not getting the attention or the education they needed. Many of them were literally failing classes- and then once Covid started I saw that number multiply. So my thought is before trying to come after homeschoolers, maybe those people should focus on improving the school situation."

I had a great experience.  Many of my friends also had a good experiences. I believe I am a well-rounded individual who has friends that are liberal and conservative-from every walk of life. I believe homeschooling can be a successful thing for your family if done with thought and intentionality. I am married to a wonderful woman, have a baby on the way, doing great in my sales career. I have several siblings who are also doing great, my sister became a paralegal for one of the largest real estate law firms in our state. My brother got his degree in robotics, and now works for the city and their water department, in addition to him being technician for Blackhawk helicopters for the national guard. My homeschool graduate brother-in-law has a masters degree as a teacher- He teaches math and science at a local high school. One of my friends got a full ride scholarship to our state college for bio engineering at the age of 16, his brother also got a scholarship to the same state school. Not every homeschooler is a great success story, but most of the ones I know are. ..I have also worked with thousands of kids and teens from my community and surrounding areas. So many were falling through the cracks and not getting the attention or the education they needed. Many of them were literally failing classes- and then once Covid started I saw that number multiply. So my thought is before trying to come after homeschoolers, maybe those people should focus on improving the school situation."

I'm thankful I was able to experience that and broaden my horizons, something I never could have done in my public school. That said, these people are unqualified and are doing this for insidious reasons. Everyone thinks teaching looks easy but it's really not and I feel sorry that these children are going to suffer in the future because they didn't get an education from qualified people and instead were fed propaganda by politically motivated adults acting in bad faith."

It was so frustrating and my children suffered from it. We homeschooled and their grades got better. We joined a co-op last year and their grades and attitudes improved even more. They are more advanced now compared to other kids their same age and are not living with the anxiety they had when in public school. They are getting a more specialized education that is not politically or financially driven. They learn the truth of the worlds history and fundamentals that actually will help them be productive adults. You would think public schools would not mind having less kids so classrooms are not so over crowded. Teachers could focus more on their time with each student. .Homeschooling is not for everyone, but everyone I know that has homeschooled or is currently don‚Äôt regret it one bit."

My wife is a teacher, and well loved by her students and I must say she is AMAZING, some people are natural educators (think back to that fun teacher who really cared about their students...  yeah, I bet you can remember random knowledge from that class).  Standardized testing was meant to root out those underperforming educators however as I see it; standardized testing has only tied the hands of those good teachers and the crap teachers are still employed.  I don't have an answer, I just know that I take time to explain complex concepts to my children and try to get them interested... ever told a 10 year old about electrons spinning both directions (spin up and spin down) at the same time, until it has been observed at which time it takes only one direction and another electron somewhere else in the universe takes the other.... Yeah I don't understand it myself but my kid watched a dozen youtube videos because he was sure I was full of crap.... haha No easy answers, No one size fits all solutions but our education system is broken (don't think so? check out common core multiplication (lattice multiplication))"

It was very stressful.  There is always one child who is physical and disrupts the flow of the class.  Many of the kids just do not pay attention and are behind.  When she had her 1st child I moved in during the week and she would put her 4 month old in bed with me after she nursed her at 5.30am.  I of course loved it but my poor daughter was not happy leaving her all day.  She quit teaching after she turned two and was pregnant soon after with her 2nd baby.  She is now homeschooling a 5 and 8 year old.  It does not have anything to do with religion.  She likes being able to let them learn things they are interested in.  They do not use a computer for learning and both girls write well and are very expressive.  They have a group homeschool that meets twice a week which gives them other kids to play with although they have kids in the neighborhood to play with when they get home from school.  The 8 year old reads voraciously and I give them both books as gifts.  At the moment they do not do anything with the state...My son did homeschooling because he hated high school.  He ended up getting a GP at age 17 and was surprised at how easy the test was.  I know from my experiences that schools are dumbing kids down in many ways.

It started with the pandemic but my kids score on G&T scale & some subjects at their grade level were too easy. The political stuff, the shootings, the state of our country, lack of quality education etc are all factors in the choice. There may come a day I put them back in public school. We try to do local homeschool meet ups for socialization. Homeschooling doesn't have to be expensive, either. It was actually the more affordable option in the meantime for our family. Non religious. My kids get to ask and learn about subjects they wouldn't even touch on in public school since everyone is on the same ""track"" and there's not much freedom/flexibility in a childs individual curiosity. And the schools in the area are over crowded and have a bad rating. For now, at least, at an elementary level, I can provide a better education for them."

I know what it's like to attend schools without any resources. Some teachers get so burnt out they leave and others are crying behind closed doors but stay for the kids. ..I was not reaching my potential until I switched my junior year to an alternative program my school had just started. It was typically utilized by students who were trouble makers or not doing well. But there were a select group who attended that school for 3 hours a day online with a teacher who excelled in that environment. I ended up graduating more than a full year ahead of time - finishing my junior year in December. I went on to college and work out of Boston now but grew up in Ohio...Kids deserve funding and support. Teachers need it to survive and to teach those kids. We need to do better.

I do think that parents of children who go to public school forget that they need to supplement their education at home, and that if you object to certain lessons you can voice that to the administration ahead of time and remove your child for a short time.

Like parents aren't teaching or have power, they are just sending them to a space they are comfortable with (and homeschool bubble is real).

We had a large group of homeschoolers in my area who were generally leftist or centrist, and made up of people who didn‚Äôt believe the academics in public school were strong enough. There are MANY people that homeschool that come from the left, not just right wing extremists. Where I currently live in Oregon, most homeschoolers are the nature loving hippie types!.People homeschool for so many reasons, and a lot of time there is a great community involved. This video shows such a narrow part of homeschool."

Such an odd and dishonest take in this doco to paint homeschoolers as though they're these privileged families in society that are trying to take money away from the public school system. Instead of asking the education department to listen to why parents are taking their kids out of school they instead want to blame homeschoolers for public schools failing and being underfunded. Anyways, as intrigued as I was watching this, it was painful at times.  Like where is the outrage at kids (and teachers) being sexually and violently attacked at school..The education system is failing because it wants to indoctrinate children with values and ideals that parents don't agree with.  Also, as much as homes may not be a safe space for some children, let's also agree that schools may not a safe space for some kids also. There should be freedom to choose what is best for your family."

They need to have quality, trusted adult influences as their primary influence so they aren‚Äôt wholly reliant on each other to learn these important lessons. When left on their own, they will form a hierarchy, and they will not stand firmly in their own opinions/morals/integrity if fitting in is more practical. We homeschool in PA, and it has one of the most strict homeschool legislation in the US. We are required to submit a notarized affidavit, health records (showing contact with mandatory reporters by the way of doctors to prevent masking child abuse), a syllabus that incorporates all of the state required subjects. At the years end, we must meet with an accredited evaluator with attendance, portfolio showing improvement upon the prior year, and we still are subjected to nationwide testing so the results for those are evaluated as well. We still pay property taxes, and the only resources we get are access to our local museum. Considering what we pay into our district, it I would at least expect the children attending school to have everything that they need for success. Instead we have one of the worst districts in the country."

The local public school here has some pretty extreme behavior. My son's then 3rd grade teacher took his lunch away and told him if he didn't pray with the class, he wasn't going to eat and that he may not pray at home, but while he was in her class, he would pray. The superintendant's answer was to put my son in the hallway away from the students while they prayed. We once again complained to the school board and they became very belligerent and responded, ""well, what do you want us to do?"". I don't know, let my son eat in peace? We took both our children out of school and are homeschooling now."

How do they fare in standardized testing or in college?  We have been schooling our children since 2009 because we can simply provide a better education than the public schools we've looked at. Evidence to back up that claim? My children consistently score at the highest levels in standardized tests. One of my children will have her associates degree before she graduates from high school.  I think we're doing okay. As for asking our children what they want - do parents of public-schooled children ask their children if they would prefer to be home schooled,  and then support that choice?"

When I started working at 16, I had to pay a school tax. Now that I'm an adult, I'll be homeschooling my daughter, but my husband and I still pay school taxes. Every single person who is employed in our state has a portion of their paychecks going to the schools, whether they attended or not. The schools still get money regardless of attendance. The current system of teaching is what is failing, not the schools themselves. It's an outdated system that hasn't been updated in over a century. It's pretty obvious that batch education is ineffective and that one-on-one teaching will always be better...I also want to mention that homeschooling in my state is extremely regulated. I'm in a blue state and they do not like homeschooling so they make it a very difficult process. There is a lot of paperwork, proof of education, and teacher evaluations starting at age 6 (thanks to Covid, they lowered the age from 8). It's a huge infringement on my freedom and I understand that they are trying to prevent people from abusing the system, but the good parents always get punished in the process. The amount of regulation has discouraged many parents from doing it, which is incredibly unfortunate."

Homeschooling is going to create an even bigger gap. Kids with involved parents will be okay no matter what usually. Unfortunately we need parental involvement for a strong public education system and the extreme policies going in place and the safety issues are driving involved parents away.

But never underestimate blazing new paths. An acquaintance developed a modest income by creating homeschool art modules. It was a passion of hers, and it developed into a very sustainable income. There are some issues that frustrate me about the white population here. I thought it was very meaningful to read Sounder in 6th grade. It gave me an idea of what other populations have gone through in history. I am concerned it will become a new intentional or unintentional segregation just when children are in   racially diverse settings. That's a setback."

Yes our faith and what we value  is one of them, but beyond that, I want my kids to have an education catered to the way they learn and that provides them with time in the day to delve deeper into the topics that interest them (maps currently for my second grader), and to have time to shadow or experience career interests in HS before having to pay for a college major. Beyond that, I don't want my kids to be overburdened by too many things going on and too much homework like I was with private school or too many sports like my husband. Being in the home environment  it's my hope that they also learn how to ""adult"" by being around when I do laundry, taxes, grocery shop, or hubby cooks...There are so many things to learn and when so many schools in my state don't even have a single student who is at grade level for reading or math, I'm certainly not going to trust them with my children. (It's not for lack of funding, some of these schools are spending $20,000+/student while schools with much lower funding have students doing better.)"

Our child is performing well above grade level and is confident, curious, and skilled.  It has been the most rewarding endeavor of my life to date, bar none.  Let me be clear: there is enormous personal sacrifice.  If you homeschool you must have the character to be completely different and always swim upstream.  I receive no income and have to purchase all materials, but I have teaching skill and drive so scaffolding, introducing topics, and reinforcing skills sets is a cinch to me.  Also, I am pushed to the margins socially.  People truly do not understand what it is that I do.  However, they are always quick to remark how well-behaved our kid is, and how smart.  I wish I could get this across to other parents: you have to show up and put in the time or your kid will turn in to someone you don't like and can't recognize, i.e. someone raised by the state.  You have to ask about the conditioning you received in public school and if you are prepared to project that same conditioning onto your offspring, i.e. outgrouping, bullying, intellectual stifling.   Unfortunately, some parents cant or won't home educate because of societal pressure.  You have to ask yourself, what can I live with?  What can I live without?  It takes a level of bravery and grit most people aren't prepared for.  Also, wages are far too low to make most of this possible for most people who have kids and also work, anyway.  I get that.  Another major issue is devaluation of home-based work.  If full-time parents were actually paid for their job, you would see a lot more homeschooling take place.  Parents would get to spend more time with their kids, and post-pandemic we've already seen a clear shift to workers preferring home-based employment.  .Now, our kid is requesting attendance at public school because she doesn't have any siblings and is ready for more socialization.  I am terrified the schools will brutally disappoint us...again.  The threat of gun violence alone should be enough to terrify any parent.  We grilled the current school on their response practices and did research about the threat of violence in our area.  It does little to assure me of any level of safety.  Also, we already tried this reluctantly last fall in another community before promptly removing our kid again and let's just say the professional misbehavior on the part of the staff was appalling beyond belief.  The principal stated, ""I'm sorry, this should never have happened."" Never in a million years was I prepared for the teacher misbehavior I encountered.  Currently, our schools are a dumpster fire, just like every other cultural institution."

But I remember a lot of home schooling mixed with boy scouts when I was in cub scouts, was weird, fun but different, and now that I look back on it, I would say the vibe was similar to these home schools. It was a lot when I became the next level,  which I remember as ""wolf""? But all we did then was play football and cook outdoors/camp. Nothing else."

One has a masters degree and the other a Ph.D.  I don't have a degree, but I was an honors student.  I think the best way to regulate homeschooling is to require annual standardized testing among a choice of major tests and to require parents and children to be part of a group that meets at least biweekly and the state should send a nurse to teach about recognizing signs and risk factors of negligence and abuse and require all parents in the group to be mandatory reporters of abuse and negligence.  I had very bad experiences in the public schools.  I would have preferred to have sent my children to a good quality Christian school, but I couldn't afford it.  Fortunately, our homeschool group offered group classes with mothers who had knowledge in various fields, such as one with a masters in biology.  When my children turned 14, I started them in part time community college classes.  My son got his bachelor's degree before his 19th birthday."

Amber Johnston, the black homeschooling mum demonstrated a great example of a healthy, typical approach of homeschooling ie wanting choice, the best for their kids, encouraging open rational thinking, however, she didn't have power herself or even collectively with like minded homeschoolers. By necessity she had to sign up to HDSLA for protection, not because it reflected her beliefs. The majority of this episode appeared to actually focus on right wing religious indoctrination to create a future fundamentalist state, steam rolling over legislation that sounds like it could actually help stop abuse towards children.

Who is more qualified to teach a child of a rocket scientist or a successful business owner or skilled engineers or tradesmen? The rocket scientist or a c+ college graduate that took 2 years to figure out what they wanted to do as an adult?  Licensed teachers aren‚Äôt always smarter or wiser than a parent.

I was judged and out numbered and thought I was crazy for feeling I was only one. I wish I had seen this year's ago üò≠ my daughter has been with grandparents because of her being in catholics school, I had to let staywith them so I could clean up the mess I was left to deal with after cutting ties with my ex. They just took over. leaving me to recover from trauma alone. I overcame the mental illness I suffered due to the severity and I feel I  know what is best and I want my daughter to be with me I also want what's best and I felt at one point, my illness was my self doubt. I am not the thing I was made felt I was  by toxic people. I questioned my own sanity for not being able to see red flags and acting on it sooner. Im smarter then that, so after bing mentally broken I come a long ways. I would not have had it in me to keep fighting to get what I needed to have a good home for my daughter and succeeded. Except my  daughter with them. And they make it so she will never leave. üòî. I had her with me during lock up and we did amazing I actually loved it and I thought that would have just continued.. I was wrong. I don't have money or support system that are able to help me with stuff other then my exs family.. And they are good at making a person feel insignificant inferior. They are entitled to my daughter and I'm without the tools to be able to deal with this without them just getting whatever they want having their way as a mother this is stunted my growth and build a whole new type of pain that I'm currently trying to overcome. Watching this at least gave me a sense of relief for feeling that wasn't wrong and I wish I should have done more stick up for that now I feel like anything I do just end up pushing her further away because she's happy and she has everything that she want cuz they spoil her and she doesn't have to see any of what I believe or say and standby assomething she has to take seriously., their programming her against me. Currently dealing with them trying to take my fourteen-year-old cross the border from Canada to Las Vegas with her aunt whose only thirty-two and already has had plastic surgery and implant and she's already beautiful and a rich boyfriend and this is after I was told that she was getting her nose pierced and thank God I had time to like intercept because they were just going to take her without even bringing it up to me she's supposed to be just there so she's going to school but they're taking it's too far and if there are the people that raised my ex then I definitely have reason for concern on whether they are suitable raising my daughter"

Yet the public school system has been under attack and abandoned for some time, and any educated person can figure out why and when it started. Homeschooling is not the answer for everyone, nor is a public school, but one thing is sure: no one is doing it with the kids and the future in mind. It seems like, everyone is looking for an excuse to separate themselves rather than build a better community. Good luck and Good vibes everyone."

He made it clear, I spend 8 minutes transferring from one class to the next, it takes the teacher 10 to 15 minutes to take control of the class before they can start teaching and then the class becomes unruly 10 minutes later which takes the teach another 10 minutes to control so out of the 50 minutes allowed for the class we get maybe 10 min of actual learning. So I talked to a friend of mind who was home schooling (which was very controversial at the time, as the state took his kids away from him for a short period of time. the state calmed he could not home school and his kids were delinquent in going to school as the public school system was loosing money when he kids did not attend. this whole mess went to court and the state lost.)(Colorado by the way) we decided to home school. the only problem at that time and it may still be, is that most home school books you could buy at that time were very heavily based on religion. I do not think religion should be involved in teaching. so I had to really search for material to use. Home schooling is hard to do. but it can be done. My son went on to collage and graduated with very high honors.  The one thing I must stress is your child needs outside activities to help them learn to socialize, voluntary civic activities, boy scouts etc... they must be able to interact with there peers."

Parents want the glory of parenting not the process. My mum had her own accounting business. She set up a classroom in her office building. She paid for a private teacher to teach us in the room from 8am-12 am - She did art with us from 12-2pm. 2pm-4pm our personal teacher would take us to museums and galleries or just the park. Then my mum would take us home.  Dad would do cooking in the evenings and that would be our science class. Parents need to do better. These schools are really crap. Why would you put children you love into schools that are terrible.

Of course, the assumption of some narratives is necessary to tell any story, and there are many angles which are both critical and impartial, but some are not and are instead wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing - the wolf, at best, being a wolf of bad journalism and at worst a wolf of blood-thirst. The direction in which the narrative is pushed is also highly sensitive to the topic; in some cases one attitude and style of questioning will prove to show journalistic integrity while, in another case, that same attitude and style of questioning will alter the truth dramatically.

How would opposing Raylee's Law protect the homeschooling community? Well the fact is the wording of Raylee's law included 'suspected of' so that law was open to the potential for abuse and potential motive could of been as simple as public school funding. Without that particular wording I doubt they would of opposed the law.

The media establishment gets the last word, naturally, but, in Vice‚Äôs case, should be much more careful not to swing the message one way or another. Of course, the assumption of some narratives is necessary to tell any story, and there are many angles which are both critical and impartial, but some are not and are instead wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing - the wolf, at best, being a wolf of bad journalism and at worst a wolf of blood-thirst. The direction in which the narrative is pushed is also highly sensitive to the topic; in some cases one attitude and style of questioning will prove to show journalistic integrity while, in another case, that same attitude and style of questioning will alter the truth dramatically. It‚Äôs important for a news company to discern the many nuances of this fact‚Ä¶ but what do I know, I haven‚Äôt even finished the video."

The world is unfair. Not every parent loves their child, not every child is given every opportunity they need or deserve. Some children are abused at home, should we get rid of homes and families? Some children are abused at schools, should we get rid of schools? Some people drive intoxicated, should we get rid of all cars to make life fair? No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you. Fix the public schools, sure...but also let the homeschoolers have their own tax dollars to use to educate their children as they see fit (parents in the public school, their tax dollars go to public education, they are choosing that, fair yes?). You don't have to control everything.....you can't. Accept the truth that there will always be successful people and people who fall behind, no matter what you do"

No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you.

VICE tends to show their bias in their videos, which most of the videos I enjoy because they are well made but it's always with a clear underlying message, motived by their own worldview and bias. At the end of the day, it's similar to capitalism, if the product is unsatisfactory, the customer goes somewhere else. In this case, our schools are underperforming in academia and over performing in political manipulation. Customers don't want to buy the product anymore."

The world is unfair. Not every parent loves their child, not every child is given every opportunity they need or deserve. Some children are abused at home, should we get rid of homes and families? Some children are abused at schools, should we get rid of schools? Some people drive intoxicated, should we get rid of all cars to make life fair? No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you. Fix the public schools, sure...but also let the homeschoolers have their own tax dollars to use to educate their children as they see fit (parents in the public school, their tax dollars go to public education, they are choosing that, fair yes?). You don't have to control everything.....you can't. Accept the truth that there will always be successful people and people who fall behind, no matter what you do"

We had a large diversity of students, from well-to-do families to those who lived in poverty.  From children who benefitted from being exposed to the culture at large, to those who never had a book read to them at home...  We taught all of them.  The teachers I worked with were extremely hard working, dedicated, and loved teaching.  It was not a cushy job and was often quite stressful.  Watching this youtube, these children have the benefit of having parents with the time and ability to give their children complete attention.  For most of us, that arrangement is more than we are able to provide.  Also, it appears that many of these homeschoolers are not in pubic school because of their parent's religious beliefs that I fear they want to impose in our public schools.  This is totally unacceptable to me.  This country has a separation of church and state in our constitution, we are NOT a Christian nation.  Homeschooling allows them that choice, but their attempt to force their beliefs into our public schools is highly problematic to the public at large."

The world is unfair. Not every parent loves their child, not every child is given every opportunity they need or deserve. Some children are abused at home, should we get rid of homes and families? Some children are abused at schools, should we get rid of schools? Some people drive intoxicated, should we get rid of all cars to make life fair? No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you. Fix the public schools, sure...but also let the homeschoolers have their own tax dollars to use to educate their children as they see fit (parents in the public school, their tax dollars go to public education, they are choosing that, fair yes?). You don't have to control everything.....you can't. Accept the truth that there will always be successful people and people who fall behind, no matter what you do"

The world is unfair. Not every parent loves their child, not every child is given every opportunity they need or deserve. Some children are abused at home, should we get rid of homes and families? Some children are abused at schools, should we get rid of schools? Some people drive intoxicated, should we get rid of all cars to make life fair? No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you. Fix the public schools, sure...but also let the homeschoolers have their own tax dollars to use to educate their children as they see fit (parents in the public school, their tax dollars go to public education, they are choosing that, fair yes?). You don't have to control everything.....you can't. Accept the truth that there will always be successful people and people who fall behind, no matter what you do"

Of course, the assumption of some narratives is necessary to tell any story, and there are many angles which are both critical and impartial, but some are not and are instead wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing - the wolf, at best, being a wolf of bad journalism and at worst a wolf of blood-thirst. The direction in which the narrative is pushed is also highly sensitive to the topic; in some cases one attitude and style of questioning will prove to show journalistic integrity while, in another case, that same attitude and style of questioning will alter the truth dramatically.

The world is unfair. Not every parent loves their child, not every child is given every opportunity they need or deserve. Some children are abused at home, should we get rid of homes and families? Some children are abused at schools, should we get rid of schools? Some people drive intoxicated, should we get rid of all cars to make life fair? No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you. Fix the public schools, sure...but also let the homeschoolers have their own tax dollars to use to educate their children as they see fit (parents in the public school, their tax dollars go to public education, they are choosing that, fair yes?). You don't have to control everything.....you can't. Accept the truth that there will always be successful people and people who fall behind, no matter what you do"

We had a large diversity of students, from well-to-do families to those who lived in poverty.  From children who benefitted from being exposed to the culture at large, to those who never had a book read to them at home...  We taught all of them.  The teachers I worked with were extremely hard working, dedicated, and loved teaching.  It was not a cushy job and was often quite stressful.  Watching this youtube, these children have the benefit of having parents with the time and ability to give their children complete attention.  For most of us, that arrangement is more than we are able to provide.  Also, it appears that many of these homeschoolers are not in pubic school because of their parent's religious beliefs that I fear they want to impose in our public schools.  This is totally unacceptable to me.  This country has a separation of church and state in our constitution, we are NOT a Christian nation.  Homeschooling allows them that choice, but their attempt to force their beliefs into our public schools is highly problematic to the public at large."

Without that particular wording I doubt they would of opposed the law.

Meeting a quota is killing our schools. If a Muslem taught a Christian child religion without the parents permission there would be outrage. It is a two way street. Respect the religion and culture of others. Home schooling puts control back into the hands of parents. Mine will learn respect for those who are different. That's the power of home schooling.

Religion restricts our growth and ability to work with those who have separate belief systems. Everyone who is focused on a fairytale existence  in a after life that can not be proven is wasting time in the real life they are actually living. Instead of working towards a improvable non-existant life use that time to become better in the you actually have now.

The world is unfair. Not every parent loves their child, not every child is given every opportunity they need or deserve. Some children are abused at home, should we get rid of homes and families? Some children are abused at schools, should we get rid of schools? Some people drive intoxicated, should we get rid of all cars to make life fair? No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you. Fix the public schools, sure...but also let the homeschoolers have their own tax dollars to use to educate their children as they see fit (parents in the public school, their tax dollars go to public education, they are choosing that, fair yes?). You don't have to control everything.....you can't. Accept the truth that there will always be successful people and people who fall behind, no matter what you do"

We had a large diversity of students, from well-to-do families to those who lived in poverty.  From children who benefitted from being exposed to the culture at large, to those who never had a book read to them at home...  We taught all of them.  The teachers I worked with were extremely hard working, dedicated, and loved teaching.  It was not a cushy job and was often quite stressful.  Watching this youtube, these children have the benefit of having parents with the time and ability to give their children complete attention.  For most of us, that arrangement is more than we are able to provide.  Also, it appears that many of these homeschoolers are not in pubic school because of their parent's religious beliefs that I fear they want to impose in our public schools.  This is totally unacceptable to me.  This country has a separation of church and state in our constitution, we are NOT a Christian nation.  Homeschooling allows them that choice, but their attempt to force their beliefs into our public schools is highly problematic to the public at large."

Whatever the children need is the priority. There are wrong reasons for homeschooling such as theocratic policy and fascist politics, which often overlap. Sometimes, the school environments are too violent and home schooling would be the better option. That said, the minimum requirement of a family is to provide safety. When that requirement is not met, then, for some children, school can represent a safer option, regardless of educational considerations. Yet, as mentioned in these comments, there are some parents who are equipped  intellectually and emotionally to provide their children a better learning environment than can public school. I was not home schooled, but my Yale graduated father provided me with more education than my public schooling ever did, and he did so with loving care; reading to us, copious subjects, hands on field and travel. I am forever indebted to his dedication."

In fact, if a book is on a ban list in some of these backwards states, it goes without saying my child will read it. We're not going to focus solely on Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus whilst ignoring curriculum that teaches basic life principles like budgeting, tax, and law. She's going to learn about first aid, physical and mental health, she's going to spend more time outside than stuck in a classroom. Is my motivation for homeschooling political? To some degree, yes, because I want my kid to go into the world and create a positive change. I want her to learn how to examine information critically and form her own opinions, not just how to bubble in the right answer on a spreadsheet.

If the school has less students they won't need as much money to run their school and their should also be more competition in the education space so that public schools can't keep getting away with their lack luster educational offerings.

Teamwork, good physical strength, overall good health go hand in hand w. those basic competencies. Also good citizenship. That's learned thru the role modeling by adults around them. Tax $$ should NOT be funding any level of self actualization. That is to be done at home. Same with protecting mother tounges or cultural practices which are different from the society that they are currently living in. Taxpayers want education to provide a new generation of taxpayers. End. Everything else is extra but important. Families have responsibility to support their children by educating them in those areas that are important to them personally. And to protect them from those who want to alienate their kids from fitting into the family goals for their financial future, which means being able to fit into the society that they live within while respecting the family moral belief.

Predictably you had millions of Evangelical parents who responded by dropping out of the system altogether....Second, they integrated students from lower and middle income households (yes, and with an obvious racial association) without holding all students to the level of discipline that middle class households demand.

He loved cooking. It's an obviously useful and up there (yes, it's tourist country) lucrative trade. I didn't push him forward by getting more resources for his school (which was for that time also mine), I pushed him forward by helping to opt him out of that school...And _that_ push forward can be obtained for the young adults you care about as well (is seventh grade starting the year they have their thirteenth birthday in US as well, or not?

However, school choice programs need to protect teacher salaries and benefits, plus the right to whistleblower protection for waste, fraud and abuse.  Public schools could rent unused buildings and facilities to private schools and community organizations to help offset the cost of maintenance.  Students thrive better in smaller schools and have many more leadership opportunities.  For example, if you have a 100 student school versus a 1000 student school, ten times more students can serve in student council.  It helps to have the principal b know everyone by name.  I am no fan of public schools, but narrowing the purpose to excellent special ed, trades, tech and science support would be helpful whole the independent schools can do the non-specialized education quite well."

I was taken out due to fear of learning ""Evolution"", was unable to speak to any other kids due to fear of them not being Christian. They used the 4H buildings as a meeting place to indoctrinate us. My mother did the little exams they did and sent them back for good results. NO ONE CAME TO HELP. NO ONE. No social services, nothing. WHY?  I lived in fear everyday because of the insane abuse I went through. I had to train to kill Muslims, and be ready everyday for my neck to be slit for the love of god. ..I was put into a room for seven, fucking, years. Until one day at church, a girl noticed the abuse and adopted me with their parents and I was able to experience public school a highschool. I could barely walk, talk, let alone didn't even know I had to put my name on the top of papers. My mother left to sleep with more men. I couldn't understand a family, and had no skills and eventually was kicked out of their house due to accusations of homosexuality. When in reality I was just platonically in love with the person who saved me.  I had no idea what love was, and just felt for the first time in my life valued. Was so used to the screaming, hitting, forced tickling when crying, fear of making ANY sound. ..I'm 27 now, still I have severe ptsd, and trying to live however I know I am mentally underdeveloped from Homeschooling. I never had a crush like normal kids, and therefore I don't know what I like. I just feel broken. ..I worked since 8 years old cleaning beach houses as she sat down and watched. Everything was so so fucking painful. I know the ptsd even with therapy will catch up to me soon one day. I just feel... too behind and unable to comprehend reasons like living. One day it will all catch up with me and I can't handle much anymore, my only wish is for these ""Homeschool"" children to be investigated. Every single one. The papers and tests they sent in for me was forged, and that was it? Fuckin kids don't get access to the mailbox. How was I supposed to get help? How are the others supposed to get help?

Of course, the assumption of some narratives is necessary to tell any story, and there are many angles which are both critical and impartial, but some are not and are instead wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing - the wolf, at best, being a wolf of bad journalism and at worst a wolf of blood-thirst. The direction in which the narrative is pushed is also highly sensitive to the topic; in some cases one attitude and style of questioning will prove to show journalistic integrity while, in another case, that same attitude and style of questioning will alter the truth dramatically.

The judge in charge of the case did NOT follow state law but the 2 attorneys who supposedly worked for me both said the judge did not have to follow the law!  He could basically do whatever he wanted in his court.  I was not allowed (can you believe that?!?) to present state laws or scientific studies refuting the judges claims to the court.  ..One thing I did early on, was I listened to all the people claiming my kids lacked social skills & academic skills, then I said, ""Ok!  Let's test that!""  They had already passed medical exams and shown excellent fitness (contrary to the claims that they lacked it from not getting organized sports -they didn't consider martial arts, nature skills & swordplay to be ""organized?"")  I cited EVERY SINGLE CLAIM against my kids and suggested they be tested.  ..After 3 months in public schools ALL their teachers said they were good students and that they showed no problems interacting with either adults or students.  They were tested using all the standardized tests available in the state (I recommended some from Texas, but they declined those).  I scolded one of my kids because on one of her tests she ""only"" scored 90%.  Most tests placed my kids in the 93-99% range.  After testing my older daughter was skipped ahead a grade in mathematics.  They were examined by psychologists who gave glowing reports (nice, sense I had already identified 3 others in case one of the state-hired shrinks gave a false report; that saved me some money)...With 100% of the claims proven to be false, the judge then decided to attack our schooling methods (despite them being very similar to some of the most elite private schools in North America).  He demanded an entire year of lesson plans for each child to include readings & questions, exams, etc.  NOTE: ZERO public school teachers must do that...There is extreme hostility to homeschooling by leftists who believe Christian parents have no right to educate their own children!"

A governess.  A Governess woman employed as a private tutor, who teaches and trains a child or children in their home. A governess often lives in the same residence as the children she is teaching. In contrast to a nanny, the primary role of a governess is teaching, rather than meeting the physical needs of children; hence a governess is usually in charge of school-aged children, rather than babies..The position of governess used to be common in affluent European families before the First World War, especially in the countryside where no suitable school existed nearby and when parents preferred to educate their children at home rather than send them away to boarding school for months at a time, and varied across time and countries. Governesses were usually in charge of girls and younger boys. When a boy was old enough, he left his governess for a tutor or a school..These people are just poor."

For now, my opinion is that this is just another feature of western individualism. I am not saying individualism is all bad but an imbalance of it can have some long term negative affects as hive thinking can as well. Asian countries clearly have societal issues due to this, like high suicide numbers...The kid in the beginning thinks the reason for her being home schooled is because of masks. I get that to a point wearing masks was annoying but does she also understand that sometimes, for the sake of others, when we live in community, we have to be willing to sacrifice for others? That my freedoms are not the end? We cant just choose to not live in community with people bc we dont want to do something. Also, if you are ever wrong about something and you avoid those who hold other perspectives, how will you ever learn or change? Learning is not about learning certain facts, its about developing the mechanisms of learning like critical thinking.  I work in the religious sector and most parents who take their kids out of public school do it to seperate their kids from views they dont agree with. That is just not what our religion teaches us, nor better for individual kids and society as a whole. I am not saying every experience of homeschooling is bad. I am just saying there are things homeschoolers will miss as will public school students who dont get homeschooled. Our system has to be better...I think this ""'learn what you want...' is good for kids"" might be true but in the end, it is an excuse for ""learn what we want you to learn only...."" Parents should absolutely have the right to choose what their children learn but parents should also know that their thinking is absolutely limited by their lack of knowledge. You dont know what you dont know. Its like people who read and article about global warning thinking they have the same knowledge as a climate scientist. No amount of googling is equal to years of research and acedemic study. There is a role for parents and professionals in the field. Some humility is needed. This "" bc I am the parent, I know best..."" is not always true. Its more like, ""bc I am the parent, I have the right..."" not the same thing..."

The media establishment gets the last word, naturally, but, in Vice‚Äôs case, should be much more careful not to swing the message one way or another. Of course, the assumption of some narratives is necessary to tell any story, and there are many angles which are both critical and impartial, but some are not and are instead wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing - the wolf, at best, being a wolf of bad journalism and at worst a wolf of blood-thirst. The direction in which the narrative is pushed is also highly sensitive to the topic; in some cases one attitude and style of questioning will prove to show journalistic integrity while, in another case, that same attitude and style of questioning will alter the truth dramatically.

My nephew's son has always been Hs'd and unfortunately, he has zero social skills at 11 years old. His mother (his teacher) doesn't either. He has no friends and neither does his mother, so I do wonder how he is going to cope once he goes out into the real world one day. I feel public school might have helped him build some social skills."

The world is unfair. Not every parent loves their child, not every child is given every opportunity they need or deserve. Some children are abused at home, should we get rid of homes and families? Some children are abused at schools, should we get rid of schools? Some people drive intoxicated, should we get rid of all cars to make life fair? No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you. Fix the public schools, sure...but also let the homeschoolers have their own tax dollars to use to educate their children as they see fit (parents in the public school, their tax dollars go to public education, they are choosing that, fair yes?). You don't have to control everything.....you can't. Accept the truth that there will always be successful people and people who fall behind, no matter what you do"

We had a large diversity of students, from well-to-do families to those who lived in poverty.  From children who benefitted from being exposed to the culture at large, to those who never had a book read to them at home...  We taught all of them.  The teachers I worked with were extremely hard working, dedicated, and loved teaching.  It was not a cushy job and was often quite stressful.  Watching this youtube, these children have the benefit of having parents with the time and ability to give their children complete attention.  For most of us, that arrangement is more than we are able to provide.  Also, it appears that many of these homeschoolers are not in pubic school because of their parent's religious beliefs that I fear they want to impose in our public schools.  This is totally unacceptable to me.  This country has a separation of church and state in our constitution, we are NOT a Christian nation.  Homeschooling allows them that choice, but their attempt to force their beliefs into our public schools is highly problematic to the public at large."

How would opposing Raylee's Law protect the homeschooling community? Well the fact is the wording of Raylee's law included 'suspected of' so that law was open to the potential for abuse and potential motive could of been as simple as public school funding. Without that particular wording I doubt they would of opposed the law.

VICE tends to show their bias in their videos, which most of the videos I enjoy because they are well made but it's always with a clear underlying message, motived by their own worldview and bias. At the end of the day, it's similar to capitalism, if the product is unsatisfactory, the customer goes somewhere else.

I also believe if we want to evolve to the next level of proactive human beings we need to move away from religion.  Religion restricts our growth and ability to work with those who have separate belief systems. Everyone who is focused on a fairytale existence  in a after life that can not be proven is wasting time in the real life they are actually living. Instead of working towards a improvable non-existant life use that time to become better in the you actually have now.

We had a large diversity of students, from well-to-do families to those who lived in poverty.  From children who benefitted from being exposed to the culture at large, to those who never had a book read to them at home...  We taught all of them.  The teachers I worked with were extremely hard working, dedicated, and loved teaching.  It was not a cushy job and was often quite stressful.  Watching this youtube, these children have the benefit of having parents with the time and ability to give their children complete attention.  For most of us, that arrangement is more than we are able to provide.  Also, it appears that many of these homeschoolers are not in pubic school because of their parent's religious beliefs that I fear they want to impose in our public schools.  This is totally unacceptable to me.  This country has a separation of church and state in our constitution, we are NOT a Christian nation.  Homeschooling allows them that choice, but their attempt to force their beliefs into our public schools is highly problematic to the public at large."

The world is unfair. Not every parent loves their child, not every child is given every opportunity they need or deserve. Some children are abused at home, should we get rid of homes and families? Some children are abused at schools, should we get rid of schools? Some people drive intoxicated, should we get rid of all cars to make life fair? No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you. Fix the public schools, sure...but also let the homeschoolers have their own tax dollars to use to educate their children as they see fit (parents in the public school, their tax dollars go to public education, they are choosing that, fair yes?). You don't have to control everything.....you can't. Accept the truth that there will always be successful people and people who fall behind, no matter what you do"

Well the fact is the wording of Raylee's law included 'suspected of' so that law was open to the potential for abuse and potential motive could of been as simple as public school funding.

The media establishment gets the last word, naturally, but, in Vice‚Äôs case, should be much more careful not to swing the message one way or another. Of course, the assumption of some narratives is necessary to tell any story, and there are many angles which are both critical and impartial, but some are not and are instead wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing - the wolf, at best, being a wolf of bad journalism and at worst a wolf of blood-thirst. The direction in which the narrative is pushed is also highly sensitive to the topic; in some cases one attitude and style of questioning will prove to show journalistic integrity while, in another case, that same attitude and style of questioning will alter the truth dramatically. It‚Äôs important for a news company to discern the many nuances of this fact‚Ä¶ but what do I know, I haven‚Äôt even finished the video."

Meeting a quota is killing our schools. If a Muslem taught a Christian child religion without the parents permission there would be outrage. It is a two way street. Respect the religion and culture of others. Home schooling puts control back into the hands of parents. Mine will learn respect for those who are different. That's the power of home schooling.

I also believe if we want to evolve to the next level of proactive human beings we need to move away from religion.  Religion restricts our growth and ability to work with those who have separate belief systems. Everyone who is focused on a fairytale existence  in a after life that can not be proven is wasting time in the real life they are actually living. Instead of working towards a improvable non-existant life use that time to become better in the you actually have now.

The world is unfair. Not every parent loves their child, not every child is given every opportunity they need or deserve. Some children are abused at home, should we get rid of homes and families? Some children are abused at schools, should we get rid of schools? Some people drive intoxicated, should we get rid of all cars to make life fair? No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you. Fix the public schools, sure...but also let the homeschoolers have their own tax dollars to use to educate their children as they see fit (parents in the public school, their tax dollars go to public education, they are choosing that, fair yes?).

The teachers I worked with were extremely hard working, dedicated, and loved teaching.  It was not a cushy job and was often quite stressful.  Watching this youtube, these children have the benefit of having parents with the time and ability to give their children complete attention.  For most of us, that arrangement is more than we are able to provide.  Also, it appears that many of these homeschoolers are not in pubic school because of their parent's religious beliefs that I fear they want to impose in our public schools.  This is totally unacceptable to me.  This country has a separation of church and state in our constitution, we are NOT a Christian nation.  Homeschooling allows them that choice, but their attempt to force their beliefs into our public schools is highly problematic to the public at large."

Before that they were in the failing public school system. There are so many bad behaved kids in the public schools that cause major distraction along with all the other distractions throughout the day. Public schools have become a daycare and feeding center for parents. The parents have no clue what their children are learning or doing all day. It‚Äôs a huge disconnect. I enjoy home educating my kids. I am also relearning a lot of things I had forgotten in school. There are many advantages to home educating. .I get annoyed with parents when they say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help my kids because I have no idea what they are doing‚Äù. Wow! That speaks volumes with todays society. Parents need to step up and take the responsibility of being a parent and know where there kids are and what they are learning.

The media establishment gets the last word, naturally, but, in Vice‚Äôs case, should be much more careful not to swing the message one way or another. Of course, the assumption of some narratives is necessary to tell any story, and there are many angles which are both critical and impartial, but some are not and are instead wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing - the wolf, at best, being a wolf of bad journalism and at worst a wolf of blood-thirst. The direction in which the narrative is pushed is also highly sensitive to the topic; in some cases one attitude and style of questioning will prove to show journalistic integrity while, in another case, that same attitude and style of questioning will alter the truth dramatically.

The world is unfair. Not every parent loves their child, not every child is given every opportunity they need or deserve. Some children are abused at home, should we get rid of homes and families? Some children are abused at schools, should we get rid of schools? Some people drive intoxicated, should we get rid of all cars to make life fair? No. Every child will get a different education no matter what you do, even if you gave everyone the exact same thing they would still not get the same test scores. Life is unfair, uneven, unequal, and you will never be able to make it so. And I don't think you should. To those who say you should put your kids in a failing public school where...what was the stat they used? Only 1 in 4 juniors in hs were proficient in science or math or something? So I should put my kid in the failing school because it's not fair to someone else? That's not how the world works. That's an unhealthy relationship, a toxic relationship. We're not good for you, but you need to stay cause I need you. Fix the public schools, sure...but also let the homeschoolers have their own tax dollars to use to educate their children as they see fit (parents in the public school, their tax dollars go to public education, they are choosing that, fair yes?). You don't have to control everything.....you can't. Accept the truth that there will always be successful people and people who fall behind, no matter what you do"

We had a large diversity of students, from well-to-do families to those who lived in poverty.  From children who benefitted from being exposed to the culture at large, to those who never had a book read to them at home...  We taught all of them.  The teachers I worked with were extremely hard working, dedicated, and loved teaching.  It was not a cushy job and was often quite stressful.  Watching this youtube, these children have the benefit of having parents with the time and ability to give their children complete attention.  For most of us, that arrangement is more than we are able to provide.  Also, it appears that many of these homeschoolers are not in pubic school because of their parent's religious beliefs that I fear they want to impose in our public schools.  This is totally unacceptable to me.  This country has a separation of church and state in our constitution, we are NOT a Christian nation.  Homeschooling allows them that choice, but their attempt to force their beliefs into our public schools is highly problematic to the public at large."

But now im in college amd it's every English class year after year since highschool it's the same message over and over-and to be quite frank the (majority) of students see that it is BS and we've always whispered and groaned about it behind teachers backs..so me and 2/3rds of the students in the schools I've noticed are completely over it..I'm 20 so when I have kids maybe I couldve put them in school 40 years ago but I will absolutely not be putting them in school with the way it's gone."
